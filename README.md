Intro: I began learning to code March 2023. This is the culmination of my journey and everythign I have learned and accomplished since I decided to immerse myself in the tech world. I implore you to see my growth and my discovery as a newfound woman in tech and a budding web developer. 

Project #1: Tic-Tac-Toe
<img src="./images/tictactoe.png" alt="tictactoe">
    This was the first game I created. It is an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played with two players.
    I created functions that would allows for the player to input either "X" or "O" in the given spot and decide a winner at the conclusion of the game. You can also reset the game to play again.

Project 2: Dice Roll

    The dice roll was my side project in understanding random number generation with for loops. It was one of myfirst practices in understanding Python functions and was a stepping stone in learning back-end programming.

Project #3: Motivational Poster
<img src="./images/motiv-poster.png" alt="motiv-poster">
    Calling it a "motivational poster" would be a bit misleading. It's moreso aligned with a "meme". I created this utlizing the classic meme format with my newfound skills with HTML and CSS properties.

Project #4: Online Resume
<img src="./images/resume.png" alt="resume">
    This was my first ever Capstone Project. The objective was to create a professional resume with intermediate HTML skills. It was the first project where I realized how I gravitated toward front-end programming and that I enjoyed it most.

Project #5: TinderDog
<img src="./images/tinderdog.png" alt="tinderdog">
    TinderDog was the first website I designed using Bootstrap. I created a dating website for dogs that was functional and sleek. By this point, I ad developed proficiency in HTML and CSS.

Project #6: Kitsch Skincare
<img src="./images/kitsch.png" alt="kitsch">
    The purpose of this project was to test my understanding and knowledge of UI design and UX design. Using Canva, I created a fake skincare brand and its website to test whether I could create a clean and cohesive website. I made sure that my website was simple, consistent, and tailored to a specific audience.
